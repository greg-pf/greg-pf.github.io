Greg is a software engineer and Master or Engineering Management student at the Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth. From 2013 to 2017, Greg attended Northeastern University where he earned a B.S. in Computer Science and Mathematics.

Greg is passionate about the software development process and enjoys reading engineering blogs and testimonials about experiences with various development methodologies. His interest in development methodologies arose during the course of his Northeastern Co-Op with [clypd](http://clypd.com/) where he received his first exposure to Agile Development outside of the classroom.

During his second Co-Op, Greg worked with [Wayfair's](https://www.wayfair.com/) Data Science team to improve upon the model used to attribute sales revenue to the company's television advertising efforts. His exposure to the academic and research oriented nature of the Data Science team ultimately cemented Greg's decision to pursue an advanced degree.

Recently, Greg has taken an interest in applying machine learning solutions to problems in computer vision and is actively working on a project to identify major terrain features in satellite imagery. You can find more information about his work on that project [here](https://github.com/greg-pf/magellan).
