## Greg Pfadenhauer

Greg is a senior at Northeastern University where he studies computer science and mathematics. Greg plans to continue his education and will be attending graduate school starting Fall of 2017.

Greg is passionate about the software development process and enjoys reading engineering blogs and testimonials about experiences with various development methodologies. His interest in development methodologies developed during the course of his Northeastern Co-Op with [clypd](http://clypd.com/) where he received his first exposure to Agile Development outside of the classroom.

During his second Co-Op, Greg worked with [Wayfair's](https://www.wayfair.com/) Data Science team to improve upon the model used to attribute sales revenue to the company's television advertising efforts. His exposure to the academic and research oriented nature of the Data Science team ultimately cemented Greg's decision to pursue an advanced degree.

Recently, Greg has taken an interest in applying Machine Learning solutions to problems in Computer Vision and is actively working on a Python/OpenCV program to identify major terrain features in satellite imagery. You can find more information about his work on that project [here](https://github.com/greg-pf/magellan).
